####  Brain-Body Analysis Special Interest Group (BBSIG)

Based on a collaborative initiative to streamline and standardize the analysis of peripheral physiological data – mainly cardiovascular activity (electrocardiography [ECG], photoplethysmography [PPG]) and respiration – in relation to brain and behavioral data, we provide a set of open-access, Python-based pipelines, implemented with the modular structure of Jupyter notebooks.
Our mission is to facilitate and enhance the reproducibility and transparency in peripheral physiological signal analysis by offering open-access, customizable pipelines with step-by-step tutorials. Whether you are a novice or an expert in brain-body interactions, BBSIG provides tools and guidance to support your research.
