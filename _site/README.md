## Personal Website

Hi, this repository contains my personal website at [michagaebler.github.io](https://michagaebler.github.io) (also via [michaelgaebler.com](https://www.michaelgaebler.com))

<hr>

The site is build with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the [Freelancer](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme) Jekyll template by [Jerome Lachaud](https://github.com/jeromelachaud) and based on the adaptations by [Leon D. Lotter](https://leondlotter.github.io).
If you want to adapt this page for your own site, just fork this repository and change it to your needs. Don't forget to credit the original theme and the intermediate adaptations!
